# Procedural terrain generation in Python

All the credit goes to the authors of *64bitdragon* blog [learn.64bitdragon.com](https://learn.64bitdragon.com/articles/computer-science/procedural-generation/midpoint-displacement-in-two-dimensions). I just changed the code to use numpy, used (in my opinion) more descriptive variable names, and added a visualization.
